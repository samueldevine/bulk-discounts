<h1>Welcome to Bulk Discounts, my final solo project in Mod 2!</h1>

<p>
This project is an extension of Little Esty Shop that allows merchants to create bulk discounts that apply to their
items.
</p>

<p>Bulk Discounts have a name, a percentage from 0 to 100, and a quantity threshold. Merchants can create, read, update,
and delete their own discounts as they see fit. Discounts obey the following rules:
<ul>
<li>They belong to a single merchant and do not affect items sold by other merchants.</li>
<li>Once created, they will automatically be applied to invoice items that have a sufficiently high quantity.</li>
<li>The valid discount with the highest percentage will always be applied, even if other valid discounts exist.</li>
<li>Discounts are applied on a per-item basis, meaning they can be applied to individual items that meet certain
quantity thresholds, without being applied to other items on the same invoice. Indivdual items must meet the quantity
threshold alone; the quantities of different items cannot be added together to qualify for a discount. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Each Merchant's invoice show pages display the total revenue that an invoice would produce before and after valid
discounts are applied. The same is true for the Admin invoice show pages.
</p>

<p>
This extension also includes an API call to <%= link_to 'Nager.Date', 'https://date.nager.at/Api' %> on each merchant's
bulk discounts index page that displays the next three upcoming public holidays in the US.
